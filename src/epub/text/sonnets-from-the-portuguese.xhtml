				<span>I thought once how Theocritus had sung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the sweet years, the dear and wished-for years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who each one in a gracious hand appears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bear a gift for mortals, old or young;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, as I mused it in his antique tongue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw, in gradual vision through my tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those of my own life, who by turns had flung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A shadow across me. Straightway I was ’ware,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a voice said in mastery, while I strove:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Guess now who holds thee!”⁠—“Death!” I said. But there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The silver answer rang: “Not Death, but Love.”</span>

				<span>Thee speaking, and me listening! and replied</span>

				<span>My sight from seeing thee⁠—that if I had died,</span>

				<span>Oh, yes! they love through all this world of ours!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will not gainsay love, called love forsooth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have heard love talked in my early youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And since, not so long back but that the flowers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then gathered, smell still. Mussulmans and Giaours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Throw kerchiefs at a smile, and have no ruth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For any weeping. Polypheme’s white tooth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slips on the nut, if after frequent showers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shell is over-smooth; and not so much</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will turn the thing called love, aside to hate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or else to oblivion. But thou art not such</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lover, my Beloved! thou canst wait</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through sorrow and sickness, to bring souls to touch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And think it soon when others cry “Too late.”</span>

				<span>I thank all who have loved me in their hearts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With thanks and love from mine. Deep thanks to all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who paused a little near the prison-wall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hear my music in its louder parts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere they went onward, each one to the mart’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or temple’s occupation, beyond call.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But thou, who, in my voice’s sink and fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the sob took it, thy divinest Art’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Own instrument didst drop down at thy foot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To harken what I said between my tears⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Instruct me how to thank thee! Oh, to shoot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My soul’s full meaning into future years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That <em>they</em> should lend it utterance, and salute</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love that endures, from Life that disappears!</span>

				<span><i>My future will not copy fair my past</i>⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I wrote that once; and thinking at my side</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My ministering life-angel justified</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The word by his appealing look upcast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the white throne of God, I turned at last,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there, instead, saw thee, not unallied</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To angels in thy soul! Then I, long tried</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By natural ills, received the comfort fast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While budding, at thy sight, my pilgrim’s staff</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave out green leaves with morning dews impearled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I seek no copy now of life’s first half:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave here the pages with long musing curled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And write me new my future’s epigraph,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New angel mine, unhoped for in the world!</span>

				<span>How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I love thee to the depth and breadth and height</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span>I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I love thee with the passion put to use</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I love thee with a love I seemed to lose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With my lost saints⁠—I love thee with the breath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smiles, tears, of all my life!⁠—and, if God choose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall but love thee better after death.</span>

				<span>Beloved, thou hast brought me many flowers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plucked in the garden, all the summer through</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And winter, and it seemed as if they grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this close room, nor missed the sun and showers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So, in the like name of that love of ours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take back these thoughts which here unfolded too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And which on warm and cold days I withdrew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From my heart’s ground. Indeed, those beds and bowers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wait thy weeding; yet here’s eglantine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here’s ivy!⁠—take them, as I used to do</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy flowers, and keep them where they shall not pine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tell thy soul their roots are left in mine.</span>
